# Assignment 1: Grow a Game and Game Analysis
## Description
The idea is that students will play Grow-A-Game, https://create-a-game.glitch.me/, a few times before developing a game that they can share with other groups.  They will then write about their game and describe it.  They will then trade their game to another group who will read their description and idea (or possible sharing depending on time and group size).  Those reading the idea will then provide a glow and grow for a member of the other group, this way each person writes feedback and receives feedback.  Then we share out games as a whole class and think about how we may remix or adjust any of the other games.
## SWBAT 
* Use grow a game in order to design an appealing and fun game
* Analyze the other game in order to provide feedback and adjustments according to a rubric
## Teacher Directions
* Do now: describe a game you enjoy to play and identify the different pieces in it (space, challenge, goal)
* Mini lesson: review grow a game components with the class and play the game as a class a few time
* Activity 1: working in groups of 3-5 students will play the game a few times.  After a few trials and ideas they will decide on one that they can have other groups try to test play and analyze
* Write out the description of the game you decided on and share it with a neighboring group
* Activity 2: With the other groups game analyze the different pieces of their game
* Try to test play or discuss through the game in order to give the other group feedback. 
* We will share out each groups game and the feedback they received from those analyzing the game
* Exit slip: pick one the games shared about and explain the different component.  Pick one component to remix and explain what you are remixing, how it will be remixed, and why that piece.
## Student Directions
* Answer Do Now on board in peardeck
* Mini Lesson CFU: Provide at least one thing that makes sense about GAG and/or at least one thing that does not make sense about GAG.
* In your group play GAG a few times on one computer https://create-a-game.glitch.me/ 
* Pitch the games and after playing 3-5 times pick one game

* Share out as a class
* Exit slip: pick one the games shared about and explain the different component.  Pick one component to remix and explain what you are remixing, how it will be remixed, and why that piece.
