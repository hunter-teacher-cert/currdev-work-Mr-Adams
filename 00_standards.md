Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.
# Standards:
* 9-12.IC.2 Debate laws and regulations that impact the development and use of computing technologies and digital information. 
* 9-12.IC.1 Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

This lesson and lesson ideas would allow us to address computing in the news issues which frame them aroud current laws and major issues.  

This lesson here is about a digital divide and access to high speed internet.  We would first look at how ISPs work and how they get approval to build or provide internet.  We will look at how funding works and then the collection of payments.  I think this opens a greate discussion on access to internet and how some will get access and new tech verse others who will not and then loose more chances in the world.  Then students would write a short response about how the government either hinders or supports the districution of new technology and specifically high speed internet.
