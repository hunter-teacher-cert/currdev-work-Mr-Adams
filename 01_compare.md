* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
  * If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
  * For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

## APCSP Courses to Compare:
* BJC (currently teaching)
* Project STEM (Amazon)(used to teach)
### Major Differences
* Project STEM provides an LMS, autograding quizes, videos for the lessons in each unit that the teach can lock or unlock.  
* Project STEM needs authorization from AFE in order to use
* BJC is a webpage with the labs and information hosted with no necessary sign in.
* BJC has deeper CS topics post AP Exam
* Project STEM moves in Python and text based programing part way through the year
### Major Similarities
* Both are blocked based coding
* Both follow a very similar curriculum order and sequence of units.
* Both have unit tests aliged to what was worked on in each unit
### Comparative Streangths & Weaknesses
* I like BJC more because it allows in my opinion for more student investigation into the concepts in order to learn them.  
* Project STEM is designed for a lot of student self pacing and a flipped classroom esque feel, which in my current school and some what my teaching philosophy I did not really like employing that curriculum.
* BJC can be self paced, but sometimes lack the supports that made Project STEM a nice platform, but I think the student challenge in BJC is worth the additonal work
* The design of Project STEM was also hard for me as the video lectures, if students were at different paces were hard to coordiante in a large class while support students who were really struggling with the work even after wathing the videos.  
* Project STEM def has better test prep pieces
### Adoption
* I am going to keep BJC but may still have students sign up in Project STEM in order to get their test prep and Create task resources since they were quite strong and useful
