# P5 Games and Design
## What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
* Freshman/Sophomore
* Not a lot of experience unless from MS, which may be p5 or Block Coding
## What is the language?
* Processing ideally in p5JS
## How does one write & run code in this language?
* Text based language in the p5 Editor or processing system
* Has a reference guide that can be used to assist with syntax and debugging
## Rate the complexity of the syntax?
* Relatively easy in that it is a specialized library of language.  
* Can do many complicated things without a ton of additional work or syntax alignment
* Does not need ; or tabs to make it work.  
## Strengths
* Easy to grasp
* Designed for beginers 
* Very applicaple for students 
* Provides deliverables early on for students
## How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
* Students want to be creative 
* Provides quick gratification for students to code and produce results.
* Small abstract art projects are very obtainable for students
## Weaknesses
* web based and NYCDOE WIFI SUCKS!!!!!! Z-SCALER IS GOING TO KILL ME!
* pretty math heavy, but can front load some of the concepts for students to see
* Requires some geuss and checks but students can keep working through that
## How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
* Yell into the ether more about the DOE having horrible internet
* Frontload the math and provide ample time for students to guess and check if they need to
* Put in additional bandwith requests
## Why did you select this language for this class?
* I think that this fits so well for students and applicability to their lives
* students want to make things and this allows them to do so
* CRE fits well with this because students can see p5 in their lives but also make digital design related to them
