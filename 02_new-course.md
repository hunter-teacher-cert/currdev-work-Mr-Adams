# Game Design Using Block to Script (Using Code.org block to JS likely or Scratch/Snap to Python/JS(p5)
* We would use game design as our driving force in the class 
* We would do some intro work around game design principals to cover basic CS concepts
* I like game design as a driving factor or reason to learn since it is fun.
* We may not all be “gamers” but almost everyone plays a cellphone game or simple game with friends so there is a connection almost all students can have. 
* I think it can be easily modified for class needs and it really interests me
* I think games cover all CS topics and are such an accessible thing for students
* We would do some intro work around game design principals to cover basic CS concepts
* Then we would use blocks to practice and understand some of the more basic concepts
* After we have designed some basic games using blocks then we will pivot to learning script syntax
* Then we will design similar games using the script based code.  
* The year would close in a gameathon that would give students the chance to design a new game form scratch (blocks or script) and play each game to provide feedback and have a great celebration
vThis would be for as many freshman as possible in order to hook them into CS by using fun game ideas.  If the course is only ½ year we would stay blocks and still lead up to a gameathon.
* I think as an intro it would be great for students since it would be pretty fun course that would show them quickly what fun and cool things you can do with coding
* It would only address the intro material of CS until students are more hooked to dive deeper into CS with an AP class.
